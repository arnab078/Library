# Welcome to LIBRARY BY ARNAB

This project that is “Online Library Management System” is a system which manage the information about the books that present in the library, their authors, the members of library to whom books are issued and library staff etc. This is very difficult task if done manually. Maintaining all this information manually is a very complex task. Owing to the advancement of technology, organization of an Online Library becomes much simple. The Online Library Management has been designed to make our work simple by computerizing and automating the operations performed over the information about the members, book issues, returns and all other operations. This computerization of library helps in many ways of its maintenance. It reduces the workload of management as most of the manual work done is reduce and also it saves our much time.
This project helps us to transform the traditional libraries into digital libraries. In traditional library system the overall work done is very slow but our project will help to overcome this and made it easy and faster.
